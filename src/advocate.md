# Better Open Source Advocate

![TODO](https://lupyuen.github.io/images/advocate-title.jpg)

2020 has been... A very challenging year!

Over the past year I've been an Open Source Advocate for Embedded and IoT. Mostly on PineTime, PinePhone, Pinebook Pro and now PineCone. (Plus a tiny slice of pie... the Raspberry kind)

I've made a couple of mistakes... But I shall improve! Here's how...

# Be Kind

Immersing myself into the Matrix / Discord / Telegram / IRC community was... Whoa! Overwhelming

There were times when I got impatient and barked (like a chinchilla)... Not realising that people among us come from various places, age groups, and have different perspectives.

I'm sorry if I have offended you... I promise to be kinder the next time I connect to the online community.
