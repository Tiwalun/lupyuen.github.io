# How It Works: BL602 GPIO

Let's look at the BL602 GPIO Functions called by the GPIO Demo Firmware: [`sdk_app_gpio.bin`](https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/tree/master/customer_app/sdk_app_gpio)

## Enable GPIO

To designate a GPIO Pin for input or output, we call these GPIO HAL Functions: [`bl_gpio.h`](https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/blob/master/components/hal_drv/bl602_hal/bl_gpio.h)


```c
int bl_gpio_enable_output(uint8_t pin, uint8_t pullup, uint8_t pulldown);
int bl_gpio_enable_input( uint8_t pin, uint8_t pullup, uint8_t pulldown);
```

-   `pin` is the GPIO Pin Number, so `pin=0` refers to GPIO 0.

-   `pullup` is set to 1 if the pin should be pulled up electrically, 0 otherwise.

-   `pulldown` is set to 1 if the pin should be pulled down electrically, 0 otherwise.

## Read and Write GPIO

To read or write a GPIO Pin, we call these GPIO HAL Functions: [`bl_gpio.h`](https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/blob/master/components/hal_drv/bl602_hal/bl_gpio.h)


```c
int bl_gpio_output_set(uint8_t pin, uint8_t value);
int bl_gpio_input_get( uint8_t pin, uint8_t *value);
int bl_gpio_input_get_value(uint8_t pin);
```

-   `pin` is the GPIO Pin Number.

-   `value` is the value to be read or written.

-   `bl_gpio_input_get` stores the value read at the pointer passed in.

These above functions are called by the GPIO Demo Firmware here: [`demo.c`](https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/blob/master/customer_app/sdk_app_gpio/sdk_app_gpio/demo.c)


## GPIO Interrupts

To allow a GPIO Pin to trigger interrupts (like when a button is pressed), we call these GPIO HAL Functions: [`bl_gpio.h`](https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/blob/master/components/hal_drv/bl602_hal/bl_gpio.h)

```c
int  bl_gpio_int_clear( uint8_t gpioPin, uint8_t intClear);
void bl_gpio_intmask(   uint8_t gpiopin, uint8_t mask);
void bl_set_gpio_intmod(uint8_t gpioPin, uint8_t intCtrlMod, uint8_t intTrgMod);
void bl_gpio_register(gpio_ctx_t *pstnode);
```

Check the GPIO HAL Source Code for details...

# Control RGB LED with PWM

Flash the __Modified PWM Demo Firmware__ to PineCone: [`sdk_app_pwm.bin`](https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/tree/master/customer_app/sdk_app_pwm)

(The firmware was modified to run without a Device Tree. [More details](https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/pull/1))

Connect to PineCone...

```bash
sudo screen /dev/ttyUSB0 2000000
```

Press the RST Button on PineCone to restart the firmware. Ignore the errors.

Press Enter to reveal the command prompt.

Assign GPIO 11 (Blue), 17 (Red), 14 (Green) to __PWM Channels__ 1, 2 and 4.  Set __PWM Frequency__ to 2 kHz. (Each LED will blink at 2,000 cycles per second)

```bash
pwm_init 1 11 2000
pwm_init 2 17 2000
pwm_init 4 14 2000
```

Set __PWM Duty Cycle__ for all 3 PWM Channels to 100%. Which means that 100% of the time, the 3 PWM Channels will be set to 1 (High). Which means total darkness: All 3 LEDs will be switched off 100% of the time.

```bash
pwm_duty_set 1 100
pwm_duty_set 2 100
pwm_duty_set 4 100
```

Start the PWM Output for all 3 PWM Channels...

```bash
pwm_start 1
pwm_start 2
pwm_start 4
```

Gradually decrease the PWM Duty Cycle for PWM Channel 1 (Blue) from 100% to 0%. This means the Blue LED will gradually get brighter...

```bash
pwm_duty_set 1 75
pwm_duty_set 1 50
pwm_duty_set 1 25
pwm_duty_set 1 0
```

To exit `screen`, press `Ctrl-A` then `k` then `y`

# How It Works: BL602 PWM

Now we look at the BL602 PWM Functions called by the PWM Demo Firmware: [`sdk_app_pwm.bin`](https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/tree/master/customer_app/sdk_app_pwm)

## Initialise PWM

To designate a GPIO PIN as a PWM Channel, we call this PWM HAL Function: [`bl_pwm.h`](https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/blob/master/components/hal_drv/bl602_hal/bl_pwm.h)

```c
int32_t bl_pwm_init(uint8_t id, uint8_t pin, uint32_t freq);
```

-   `id` is the PWM Channel ID (0 to 4). BL602 supports 5 PWM Channels: PWM 0 to PWM 4.

-   `pin` is the GPIO Pin Number, so `pin=0` refers to GPIO 0.

-   `freq` is the PWM Frequency (in Hz / Cycles Per Second). So `freq=2000` means that the PWM Channel will be blinked 2,000 cycles every second. `freq` must be between 2,000 and 800,000 (inclusive).

Not all GPIO Pins may be assigned to a PWM Channel. Check "Table 3.1: Pin description" (Page 27) in [BL602 Reference Manual](https://github.com/pine64/bl602-docs/blob/main/mirrored/Bouffalo%20Lab%20BL602_Reference_Manual_en_1.1.pdf).

## PWM Frequency and Duty Cycle

We set the Frequency and Duty Cycle on a PWM Channel by calling these PWM HAL Functions: [`bl_pwm.h`](https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/blob/master/components/hal_drv/bl602_hal/bl_pwm.h)

```c
int32_t bl_pwm_set_freq(uint8_t id, uint32_t freq);
int32_t bl_pwm_set_duty(uint8_t id, float duty);
```

-   `id` is the PWM Channel ID (0 to 4).

-   `freq` is the PWM Frequency (in Hz / Cycles Per Second). `freq` must be between 2,000 and 800,000 (inclusive).

-   `duty` is the PWM Duty Cycle (0 to 100). When `duty=25`, it means that in every PWM Cycle...

    - PWM Ouput is 1 (High) for the initial 25% of the PWM Cycle
    - Followed by PWM Output 0 (Low) for the remaining 75% of the PWM Cycle

To get the Duty Cycle for a PWM Channel, we call this function...

```c
int32_t bl_pwm_get_duty(uint8_t id, float *p_duty);
```

-   `bl_pwm_get_duty` stores the Duty Cycle at the pointer passed in `p_duty`.

## PWM Operation

We start and stop a PWM Channel by calling these PWM HAL Functions: [`bl_pwm.h`](https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/blob/master/components/hal_drv/bl602_hal/bl_pwm.h)

```c
int32_t bl_pwm_start(uint8_t id);
int32_t bl_pwm_stop( uint8_t id);
```

-   `id` is the PWM Channel ID (0 to 4).

The above PWM HAL Functions are defined here...

-   [PWM HAL Source Code](https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/blob/master/components/hal_drv/bl602_hal/bl_pwm.c)

The PWM HAL Functions are called by the PWM Demo Firmware here: [`main.c`](https://github.com/lupyuen/bl_iot_sdk/blob/master/customer_app/sdk_app_pwm/sdk_app_pwm/main.c)
