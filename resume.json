The system receives receiving a network address based on a selection from a user. The system then transmits a request for content from the network address and subsequently receives the content associated with the network address. A search is performed on the content for data that provides displaying a video content in a full screen mode. Upon detecting the data, the process generates the data and displays video content in full screen mode."
